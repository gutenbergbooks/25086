<h1>The<br />
DELEGATE<br />
FROM<br />
VENUS</h1>

<h2>By HENRY SLESAR</h2>

<p><small><b>ILLUSTRATOR NOVICK</b></small></p>

<p class="tease"><i>Everybody was waiting to see
what the delegate from Venus
looked like. And all they got
for their patience was the
biggest surprise since David
clobbered Goliath.</i></p>

<p class="cap">"<span class="dcap">Let</span> me put it this way,"
Conners said paternally.
"We expect a certain amount of
decorum from our Washington
news correspondents, and that's
all I'm asking for."</p>

<p>Jerry Bridges, sitting in the
chair opposite his employer's
desk, chewed on his knuckles
and said nothing. One part of
his mind wanted him to play it
cagey, to behave the way the
newspaper wanted him to behave,
to protect the cozy Washington
assignment he had waited
four years to get. But another
part of him, a rebel part,
wanted him to stay on the trail
of the story he felt sure was
about to break.</p>

<p>"I didn't mean to make trouble,
Mr. Conners," he said casually.
"It just seemed strange, all
these exchanges of couriers in
the past two days. I couldn't
help thinking something was
up."</p>

<p>"Even if that's true, we'll
hear about it through the usual
channels," Conners frowned.
"But getting a senator's secretary
drunk to obtain information&mdash;well,
that's not only indiscreet,
Bridges. It's downright
dirty."</p>

<p>Jerry grinned. "I didn't take
<i>that</i> kind of advantage, Mr.
Conners. Not that she wasn't a
toothsome little dish ..."</p>

<p>"Just thank your lucky stars
that it didn't go any further.
And from now on&mdash;" He waggled
a finger at him. "Watch
your step."</p>

<p>Jerry got up and ambled to the
door. But he turned before leaving
and said:</p>

<p>"By the way. What do <i>you</i>
think is going on?"</p>

<p>"I haven't the faintest idea."</p>

<p>"Don't kid me, Mr. Conners.
Think it's war?"</p>

<p>"That'll be all, Bridges."</p>

<hr />

<p>The reporter closed the door
behind him, and then strolled
out of the building into the sunlight.</p>

<p>He met Ruskin, the fat little
AP correspondent, in front of
the Pan-American Building on
Constitution Avenue. Ruskin
was holding the newspaper that
contained the gossip-column
item which had started the
whole affair, and he seemed
more interested in the romantic
rather than political implications.
As he walked beside him,
he said:</p>

<p>"So what really happened,
pal? That Greta babe really let
down her hair?"</p>

<p>"Where's your decorum?"
Jerry growled.</p>

<p>Ruskin giggled. "Boy, she's
quite a dame, all right. I think
they ought to get the Secret
Service to guard her. She really
fills out a size 10, don't she?"</p>

<p>"Ruskin," Jerry said, "you
have a low mind. For a week,
this town has been acting like
the <i>39 Steps</i>, and all you can
think about is dames. What's
the matter with you? Where
will you be when the big mushroom
cloud comes?"</p>

<p>"With Greta, I hope," Ruskin
sighed. "What a way to get
radioactive."</p>

<p>They split off a few blocks
later, and Jerry walked until he
came to the Red Tape Bar &amp;
Grill, a favorite hangout of the
local journalists. There were
three other newsmen at the bar,
and they gave him snickering
greetings. He took a small table
in the rear and ate his meal in
sullen silence.</p>

<p>It wasn't the newsmen's jibes
that bothered him; it was the
certainty that something of
major importance was happening
in the capitol. There had
been hourly conferences at the
White House, flying visits by
State Department officials, mysterious
conferences involving
members of the Science Commission.
So far, the byword
had been secrecy. They knew
that Senator Spocker, chairman
of the Congressional Science
Committee, had been involved
in every meeting, but Senator
Spocker was unavailable. His
secretary, however, was a little
more obliging ...</p>

<p>Jerry looked up from his
coffee and blinked when he saw
who was coming through the
door of the Bar &amp; Grill. So did
every other patron, but for different
reasons. Greta Johnson
had that effect upon men. Even
the confining effect of a mannishly-tailored
suit didn't hide
her outrageously feminine qualities.</p>

<p>She walked straight to his
table, and he stood up.</p>

<p>"They told me you might be
here," she said, breathing hard.
"I just wanted to thank you for
last night."</p>

<p>"Look, Greta&mdash;"</p>

<p><i>Wham!</i> Her hand, small and
delicate, felt like a slab of lead
when it slammed into his cheek.
She left a bruise five fingers
wide, and then turned and stalked
out.</p>

<hr />

<p>He ran after her, the restaurant
proprietor shouting about
the unpaid bill. It took a rapid
dog-trot to reach her side.</p>

<p>"Greta, listen!" he panted.
"You don't understand about
last night. It wasn't the way
that lousy columnist said&mdash;"</p>

<p>She stopped in her tracks.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't have minded so
much if you'd gotten me drunk.
But to <i>use</i> me, just to get a
story&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I'm a <i>reporter</i>, damn it.
It's my job. I'd do it again if
I thought you knew anything."</p>

<p>She was pouting now. "Well,
how do you suppose I feel,
knowing you're only interested
in me because of the Senator?
Anyway, I'll probably lose my
job, and then you won't have
<i>any</i> use for me."</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Greta," Jerry said
sadly.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Good-bye. I suppose you
won't want to see me any more."</p>

<p>"Did I say that?"</p>

<p>"It just won't be any use.
We'll always have this thing between
us."</p>

<p>She looked at him for a moment,
and then touched his
bruised cheek with a tender,
motherly gesture.</p>

<p>"Your poor face," she murmured,
and then sighed. "Oh,
well. I guess there's no use
fighting it. Maybe if I <i>did</i> tell
you what I know, we could act
<i>human</i> again."</p>

<p>"Greta!"</p>

<p>"But if you print one <i>word</i>
of it, Jerry Bridges, I'll never
speak to you again!"</p>

<p>"Honey," Jerry said, taking
her arm, "you can trust me like
a brother."</p>

<p>"That's <i>not</i> the idea," Greta
said stiffly.</p>

<p>In a secluded booth at the rear
of a restaurant unfrequented by
newsmen, Greta leaned forward
and said:</p>

<p>"At first, they thought it was
another sputnik."</p>

<p>"<i>Who</i> did?"</p>

<p>"The State Department, silly.
They got reports from the observatories
about another sputnik
being launched by the Russians.
Only the Russians denied
it. Then there were joint meetings,
and nobody could figure
out <i>what</i> the damn thing was."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," Jerry said
dizzily. "You mean to tell me
there's another of those metal
moons up there?"</p>

<p>"But it's not a moon. That's
the big point. It's a spaceship."</p>

<p>"A <i>what</i>?"</p>

<p>"A spaceship," Greta said
coolly, sipping lemonade. "They
have been in contact with it now
for about three days, and they're
thinking of calling a plenary
session of the UN just to figure
out what to do about it. The
only hitch is, Russia doesn't
want to wait that long, and is
asking for a hurry-up summit
meeting to make a decision."</p>

<p>"A decision about what?"</p>

<p>"About the Venusians, of
course."</p>

<p>"Greta," Jerry said mildly, "I
think you're still a little woozy
from last night."</p>

<p>"Don't be silly. The spaceship's
from Venus; they've already
established that. And the
people on it&mdash;I <i>guess</i> they're
people&mdash;want to know if they
can land their delegate."</p>

<p>"Their what?"</p>

<p>"Their delegate. They came
here for some kind of conference,
I guess. They know about
the UN and everything, and
they want to take part. They
say that with all the satellites
being launched, that our affairs
are <i>their</i> affairs, too. It's kind
of confusing, but that's what
they say."</p>

<p>"You mean these Venusians
speak English?"</p>

<p>"And Russian. And French.
And German. And everything I
guess. They've been having
radio talks with practically
every country for the past three
days. Like I say, they want to
establish diplomatic relations
or something. The Senator
thinks that if we don't agree,
they might do something drastic,
like blow us all up. It's kind
of scary." She shivered delicately.</p>

<p>"You're taking it mighty
calm," he said ironically.</p>

<p>"Well, how else can I take it?
I'm not even supposed to <i>know</i>
about it, except that the Senator
is so careless about&mdash;" She
put her fingers to her lips. "Oh,
dear, now you'll really think I'm
terrible."</p>

<p>"Terrible? I think you're
wonderful!"</p>

<p>"And you promise not to print
it?"</p>

<p>"Didn't I say I wouldn't?"</p>

<p>"Y-e-s. But you know, you're
a liar sometimes, Jerry. I've noticed
that about you."</p>

<hr />

<p>The press secretary's secretary,
a massive woman with
gray hair and impervious to
charm, guarded the portals of
his office with all the indomitable
will of the U. S. Marines.
But Jerry Bridges tried.</p>

<p>"You don't understand, Lana,"
he said. "I don't want to <i>see</i> Mr.
Howells. I just want you to <i>give</i>
him something."</p>

<p>"My name's not Lana, and I
<i>can't</i> deliver any messages."</p>

<p>"But this is something he
<i>wants</i> to see." He handed her
an envelope, stamped URGENT.
"Do it for me, Hedy. And I'll
buy you the flashiest pair of
diamond earrings in Washington."</p>

<p>"Well," the woman said,
thawing slightly. "I <i>could</i> deliver
it with his next batch of mail."</p>

<p>"When will that be?"</p>

<p>"In an hour. He's in a terribly
important meeting right
now."</p>

<p>"You've got some mail right
there. Earrings and a bracelet
to match."</p>

<p>She looked at him with exasperation,
and then gathered up
a stack of memorandums and
letters, his own envelope atop
it. She came out of the press
secretary's office two minutes
later with Howells himself, and
Howells said: "You there,
Bridges. Come in here."</p>

<p>"Yes, <i>sir</i>!" Jerry said, breezing
by the waiting reporters
with a grin of triumph.</p>

<p>There were six men in the
room, three in military uniform.
Howells poked the envelope towards
Jerry, and snapped:</p>

<p>"This note of yours. Just what
do you think it means?"</p>

<p>"You know better than I do,
Mr. Howells. I'm just doing my
job; I think the public has a
right to know about this spaceship
that's flying around&mdash;"</p>

<hr />

<p>His words brought an exclamation
from the others. Howells
sighed, and said:</p>

<p>"Mr. Bridges, you don't make
it easy for us. It's our opinion
that secrecy is essential, that
leakage of the story might cause
panic. Since you're the only unauthorized
person who knows of
it, we have two choices. One of
them is to lock you up."</p>

<p>Jerry swallowed hard.</p>

<p>"The other is perhaps more
practical," Howells said. "You'll
be taken into our confidence, and
allowed to accompany those officials
who will be admitted to the
landing site. But you will <i>not</i> be
allowed to relay the story to the
press until such a time as <i>all</i>
correspondents are informed.
That won't give you a 'scoop' if
that's what you call it, but you'll
be an eyewitness. That should
be worth something."</p>

<p>"It's worth a lot," Jerry said
eagerly. "Thanks, Mr. Howells."</p>

<p>"Don't thank me, I'm not doing
you any <i>personal</i> favor. Now
about the landing tonight&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You mean the spaceship's
coming down?"</p>

<p>"Yes. A special foreign ministers
conference was held this
morning, and a decision was
reached to accept the delegate.
Landing instructions are being
given at Los Alamos, and the
ship will presumably land
around midnight tonight. There
will be a jet leaving Washington
Airport at nine, and you'll be
on it. Meanwhile, consider yourself
in custody."</p>

<hr />

<p>The USAF jet transport
wasn't the only secrecy-shrouded
aircraft that took off that evening
from Washington Airport.
But Jerry Bridges, sitting in
the rear seat flanked by two
Sphinx-like Secret Service men,
knew that he was the only passenger
with non-official status
aboard.</p>

<p>It was only a few minutes
past ten when they arrived at
the air base at Los Alamos. The
desert sky was cloudy and starless,
and powerful searchlights
probed the thick cumulus. There
were sleek, purring black autos
waiting to rush the air passengers
to some unnamed destination.
They drove for twenty
minutes across a flat ribbon of
desert road, until Jerry sighted
what appeared to be a circle of
newly-erected lights in the middle
of nowhere. On the perimeter,
official vehicles were parked
in orderly rows, and four USAF
trailer trucks were in evidence,
their radarscopes turning slowly.
There was activity everywhere,
but it was well-ordered
and unhurried. They had done a
good job of keeping the excitement
contained.</p>

<p>He was allowed to leave the
car and stroll unescorted. He
tried to talk to some of the
scurrying officials, but to no
avail. Finally, he contented
himself by sitting on the sand,
his back against the grill of a
staff car, smoking one cigarette
after another.</p>

<p>As the minutes ticked off, the
activity became more frenetic
around him. Then the pace slowed,
and he knew the appointed
moment was approaching. Stillness
returned to the desert, and
tension was a tangible substance
in the night air.</p>

<p>The radarscopes spun slowly.</p>

<p>The searchlights converged
in an intricate pattern.</p>

<p>Then the clouds seemed to
part!</p>

<p>"Here she comes!" a voice
shouted. And in a moment, the
calm was shattered. At first, he
saw nothing. A faint roar was
started in the heavens, and it
became a growl that increased
in volume until even the shouting
voices could no longer be
heard. Then the crisscrossing
lights struck metal, glancing off
the gleaming body of a descending
object. Larger and larger
the object grew, until it assumed
the definable shape of a squat
silver funnel, falling in a perfect
straight line towards the center
of the light-ringed area. When it
hit, a dust cloud obscured it from
sight.</p>

<hr />

<p>A loudspeaker blared out an
unintelligible order, but its message
was clear. No one moved
from their position.</p>

<p>Finally, a three-man team,
asbestos-clad, lead-shielded, stepped
out from the ring of spectators.
They carried geiger counters
on long poles before them.</p>

<p>Jerry held his breath as they
approached the object; only
when they were yards away did
he appreciate its size. It wasn't
large; not more than fifteen feet
in total circumference.</p>

<p>One of the three men waved
a gloved hand.</p>

<p>"It's okay," a voice breathed
behind him. "No radiation ..."</p>

<p>Slowly, the ring of spectators
closed tighter. They were twenty
yards from the ship when the
voice spoke to them.</p>

<p>"Greetings from Venus," it
said, and then repeated the
phrase in six languages. "The
ship you see is a Venusian Class
7 interplanetary rocket, built
for one-passenger. It is clear of
all radiation, and is perfectly
safe to approach. There is a
hatch which may be opened by
an automatic lever in the side.
Please open this hatch and remove
the passenger."</p>

<p>An Air Force General whom
Jerry couldn't identify stepped
forward. He circled the ship
warily, and then said something
to the others. They came closer,
and he touched a small lever on
the silvery surface of the funnel.</p>

<p>A door slid open.</p>

<p>"It's a box!" someone said.</p>

<p>"A crate&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Colligan! Moore! Schaffer!
Lend a hand here&mdash;"</p>

<p>A trio came forward and
hoisted the crate out of the ship.
Then the voice spoke again;
Jerry deduced that it must have
been activated by the decreased
load of the ship.</p>

<p>"Please open the crate. You
will find our delegate within.
We trust you will treat him
with the courtesy of an official
emissary."</p>

<p>They set to work on the crate,
its gray plastic material giving
in readily to the application of
their tools. But when it was
opened, they stood aside in
amazement and consternation.</p>

<p>There were a variety of metal
pieces packed within, protected
by a filmy packing material.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," the general
said. "Here's a book&mdash;"</p>

<p>He picked up a gray-bound
volume, and opened its cover.</p>

<p>"'Instructions for assembling
Delegate,'" he read aloud.
"'First, remove all parts and
arrange them in the following
order. A-1, central nervous system
housing. A-2 ...'" He looked
up. "It's an instruction book,"
he whispered. "We're supposed
to <i>build</i> the damn thing."</p>

<hr />

<p>The Delegate, a handsomely
constructed robot almost eight
feet tall, was pieced together
some three hours later, by a
team of scientists and engineers
who seemed to find the Venusian
instructions as elementary as a
blueprint in an Erector set. But
simple as the job was, they were
obviously impressed by the
mechanism they had assembled.
It stood impassive until they
obeyed the final instruction.
"Press Button K ..."</p>

<p>They found button K, and
pressed it.</p>

<p>The robot bowed.</p>

<p>"Thank you, gentlemen," it
said, in sweet, unmetallic accents.
"Now if you will please
escort me to the meeting
place ..."</p>

<hr />

<p>It wasn't until three days
after the landing that Jerry
Bridges saw the Delegate again.
Along with a dozen assorted
government officials, Army officers,
and scientists, he was
quartered in a quonset hut in
Fort Dix, New Jersey. Then,
after seventy-two frustrating
hours, he was escorted by Marine
guard into New York City.
No one told him his destination,
and it wasn't until he saw the
bright strips of light across the
face of the United Nations
building that he knew where the
meeting was to be held.</p>

<p>But his greatest surprise was
yet to come. The vast auditorium
which housed the general
assembly was filled to its capacity,
but there were new faces
behind the plaques which designated
the member nations.
He couldn't believe his eyes at
first, but as the meeting got
under way, he knew that it was
true. The highest echelons of the
world's governments were represented,
even&mdash;Jerry gulped
at the realization&mdash;Nikita Khrushchev
himself. It was a summit
meeting such as he had never
dreamed possible, a summit
meeting without benefit of long
foreign minister's debate. And
the cause of it all, a placid,
highly-polished metal robot, was
seated blithely at a desk which
bore the designation:</p>

<p class="center">VENUS.</p>

<p>The robot delegate stood up.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," it said into the
microphone, and the great men
at the council tables strained to
hear the translator's version
through their headphones, "Gentlemen,
I thank you for your
prompt attention. I come as a
Delegate from a great neighbor
planet, in the interests of peace
and progress for all the solar
system. I come in the belief that
peace is the responsibility of individuals,
of nations, and now
of worlds, and that each is dependent
upon the other. I speak
to you now through the electronic
instrumentation which
has been created for me, and I
come to offer your planet not
merely a threat, a promise, or
an easy solution&mdash;but a challenge."</p>

<p>The council room stirred.</p>

<p>"Your earth satellites have
been viewed with interest by the
astronomers of our world, and
we foresee the day when contact
between our planets will be commonplace.
As for ourselves, we
have hitherto had little desire
to explore beyond our realm,
being far too occupied with internal
matters. But our isolation
cannot last in the face of
your progress, so we believe that
we must take part in your
affairs.</p>

<p>"Here, then, is our challenge.
Continue your struggle of ideas,
compete with each other for the
minds of men, fight your bloodless
battles, if you know no
other means to attain progress.
But do all this <i>without</i> unleashing
the terrible forces of power
now at your command. Once
unleashed, these forces may or
may not destroy all that you
have gained. But we, the scientists
of Venus, promise you this&mdash;that
on the very day your conflict
deteriorates into heedless
violence, we will not stand by
and let the ugly contagion
spread. On that day, we of
Venus will act swiftly, mercilessly,
and relentlessly&mdash;to destroy
your world completely."</p>

<p>Again, the meeting room exploded
in a babble of languages.</p>

<p>"The vessel which brought me
here came as a messenger of
peace. But envision it, men of
Earth, as a messenger of war.
Unstoppable, inexorable, it may
return, bearing a different Delegate
from Venus&mdash;a Delegate of
Death, who speaks not in words,
but in the explosion of atoms.
Think of thousands of such Delegates,
fired from a vantage
point far beyond the reach of
your retaliation. This is the
promise and the challenge that
will hang in your night sky from
this moment forward. Look at
the planet Venus, men of Earth,
and see a Goddess of Vengeance,
poised to wreak its wrath upon
those who betray the peace."</p>

<p>The Delegate sat down.</p>

<hr />

<p>Four days later, a mysterious
explosion rocked the quiet sands
of Los Alamos, and the Venus
spacecraft was no more. Two
hours after that, the robot delegate,
its message delivered, its
mission fulfilled, requested to be
locked inside a bombproof
chamber. When the door was
opened, the Delegate was an exploded
ruin.</p>

<p>The news flashed with lightning
speed over the world, and
Jerry Bridges' eyewitness accounts
of the incredible event
was syndicated throughout the
nation. But his sudden celebrity
left him vaguely unsatisfied.</p>

<p>He tried to explain his feeling
to Greta on his first night back
in Washington. They were in his
apartment, and it was the first
time Greta had consented to pay
him the visit.</p>

<p>"Well, what's <i>bothering</i> you?"
Greta pouted. "You've had the
biggest story of the year under
your byline. I should think you'd
be tickled pink."</p>

<p>"It's not that," Jerry said
moodily. "But ever since I heard
the Delegate speak, something's
been nagging me."</p>

<p>"But don't you think he's done
good? Don't you think they'll be
impressed by what he said?"</p>

<p>"I'm not worried about that.
I think that damn robot did
more for peace than anything
that's ever come along in this
cockeyed world. But still ..."</p>

<p>Greta snuggled up to him on
the sofa. "You worry too much.
Don't you ever think of anything
else? You should learn to
relax. It can be fun."</p>

<p>She started to prove it to him,
and Jerry responded the way a
normal, healthy male usually
does. But in the middle of an
embrace, he cried out:</p>

<p>"Wait a minute!"</p>

<p>"What's the matter?"</p>

<p>"I just thought of something!
Now where the hell did I put
my old notebooks?"</p>

<p>He got up from the sofa and
went scurrying to a closet. From
a debris of cardboard boxes, he
found a worn old leather brief
case, and cackled with delight
when he found the yellowed
notebooks inside.</p>

<p>"What <i>are</i> they?" Greta said.</p>

<p>"My old school notebooks.
Greta, you'll have to excuse me.
But there's something I've got
to do, right away!"</p>

<p>"That's all right with me,"
Greta said haughtily. "I know
when I'm not wanted."</p>

<p>She took her hat and coat from
the hall closet, gave him one
last chance to change his mind,
and then left.</p>

<p>Five minutes later, Jerry
Bridges was calling the airlines.</p>

<hr />

<p>It had been eleven years since
Jerry had walked across the
campus of Clifton University,
heading for the ivy-choked
main building. It was remarkable
how little had changed, but
the students seemed incredibly
young. He was winded by the
time he asked the pretty girl at
the desk where Professor Martin
Coltz could be located.</p>

<p>"Professor Coltz?" She stuck
a pencil to her mouth. "Well, I
guess he'd be in the Holland
Laboratory about now."</p>

<p>"Holland Laboratory? What's
that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I guess that was after
your time, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>Jerry felt decrepit, but managed
to say: "It must be something
new since I was here.
Where is this place?"</p>

<p>He followed her directions,
and located a fresh-painted
building three hundred yards
from the men's dorm. He met a
student at the door, who told
him that Professor Coltz would
be found in the physics department.</p>

<p>The room was empty when
Jerry entered, except for the
single stooped figure vigorously
erasing a blackboard. He turned
when the door opened. If the
students looked younger, Professor
Coltz was far older than
Jerry remembered. He was a
tall man, with an unruly confusion
of straight gray hair. He
blinked when Jerry said:</p>

<p>"Hello, Professor. Do you remember
me? Jerry Bridges?"</p>

<p>"Of course! I thought of you
only yesterday, when I saw your
name in the papers&mdash;"</p>

<p>They sat at facing student
desks, and chatted about old
times. But Jerry was impatient
to get to the point of his visit,
and he blurted out:</p>

<p>"Professor Coltz, something's
been bothering me. It bothered
me from the moment I heard
the Delegate speak. I didn't
know what it was until last
night, when I dug out my old
college notebooks. Thank God
I kept them."</p>

<p>Coltz's eyes were suddenly
hooded.</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Jerry?"</p>

<p>"There was something about
the Robot's speech that sounded
familiar&mdash;I could have sworn
I'd heard some of the words
before. I couldn't prove anything
until I checked my old
notes, and here's what I found."</p>

<p>He dug into his coat pocket
and produced a sheet of paper.
He unfolded it and read aloud.</p>

<p>"'It's my belief that peace is
the responsibility of individuals,
of nations, and someday, even of
worlds ...' Sound familiar, Professor?"</p>

<p>Coltz shifted uncomfortably.
"I don't recall every silly thing
I said, Jerry."</p>

<p>"But it's an interesting coincidence,
isn't it, Professor?
These very words were spoken
by the Delegate from Venus."</p>

<p>"A coincidence&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is it? But I also remember
your interest in robotics. I'll
never forget that mechanical
homing pigeon you constructed.
And you've probably learned
much more these past eleven
years."</p>

<p>"What are you driving at,
Jerry?"</p>

<p>"Just this, Professor. I had a
little daydream, recently, and I
want you to hear it. I dreamed
about a group of teachers, scientists,
and engineers, a group
who were suddenly struck by
an exciting, incredible idea. A
group that worked in the quiet
and secrecy of a University on a
fantastic scheme to force the
idea of peace into the minds of
the world's big shots. Does my
dream interest you, Professor?"</p>

<p>"Go on."</p>

<p>"Well, I dreamt that this
group would secretly launch an
earth satellite of their own, and
arrange for the nose cone to
come down safely at a certain
time and place. They would install
a marvelous electronic robot
within the cone, ready to be
assembled. They would beam a
radio message to earth from the
cone, seemingly as if it originated
from their 'spaceship.'
Then, when the Robot was assembled,
they would speak
through it to demand peace for
all mankind ..."</p>

<p>"Jerry, if you do this&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You don't have to say it,
Professor, I know what you're
thinking. I'm a reporter, and my
business is to tell the world
everything I know. But if I
did it, there might not be a
world for me to write about,
would there? No, thanks, Professor.
As far as I'm concerned,
what I told you was nothing
more than a daydream."</p>

<hr />

<p>Jerry braked the convertible
to a halt, and put his arm
around Greta's shoulder. She
looked up at the star-filled night,
and sighed romantically.</p>

<p>Jerry pointed. "That one."</p>

<p>Greta shivered closer to him.</p>

<p>"And to think what that terrible
planet can do to us!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I dunno. Venus is also
the Goddess of Love."</p>

<p>He swung his other arm
around her, and Venus winked
approvingly.</p>
